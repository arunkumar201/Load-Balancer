# Load Balancer JS Repository

Welcome to the Load Balancer JS repository! This collection houses a diverse range of load balancer implementations using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express. Whether you're a developer looking to optimize your application's performance or just curious about load balancing strategies, this repository has you covered.

## Overview

Modern web applications demand high availability and optimal resource utilization. Load balancing plays a crucial role in achieving these goals by distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing bottlenecks, and enhancing overall system reliability. In this repository, you'll find various load balancer code snippets tailored for different use cases.

## Contents

Explore our collection of load balancers, each designed to address specific scenarios and requirements. The repository includes implementations utilizing JavaScript, Node.js, and Express, showcasing the versatility and power of these technologies.

### Load Balancer Types

- **Round Robin Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming requests in a circular sequence to each server, ensuring equal distribution of load.

- **Weighted Load Balancer:** Assigns different weights to servers based on their capacity, allowing for proportional distribution of traffic.

- **Least Connections Load Balancer:** Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections, optimizing resource utilization.

- **Session Affinity Load Balancer:** Maintains a consistent connection between a client and a specific server, ensuring session persistence.
